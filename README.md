# Token Classification from French census archives between 1836 and 1936

This project aims to structure and classify information on individuals contained in a corpus of documents. The goal is to implement a system capable of accurately identifying and categorizing data such as surname, first name, age, year of birth, relationship to head of household, nationality, and many others. This classification process would not only allow data to be organized more efficiently, but also enable more in-depth and targeted analyses.
